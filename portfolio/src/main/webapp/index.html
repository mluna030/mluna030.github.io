      <h1>Michael Luna's Portfolio</h1>
      <p>Hello! Welcome to my Portfolio</p>
      <p>About Me:</p>
      <p>I am a Current Computer Engineering student studying at California Polytechnic University, Pomona with an emphasis in Software Engineering and machine Learning. I am a proud member of the Foothill Valley IEEE chapter, and have been involved in the Cal Poly Pomona IEEE club since 2020. I am eager to learn and create new things in this world </p>
      <p>Click <a href="image.html">here</a> to see some of my favorite places as well as photography I have taken!</p>

      <p>Past Experience in:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Instrumentation testing, as well as assembling and troubleshooting dedicated controllers for Reliability Systems</li>
        <li>Functional Software testing, including GUI automation with pyautoGUI, experienced in working with developers to track backlogged issues and report bugs encountered.</li>
        <li>IT support technician, communicating with staff in order to provide the necessary support to help resolve technical issues that may arise</li>
      </ol>

      <p>Projects:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Designed and implemented a temperature sensor, that alerts the user when their environment gets too hot and turns on an external fan to cool the environment. Used a TFT screen to display the current temperature, and the alarm duration. Everything was programmed using C onto a PIC18F MCU board.</li>
        <li>implemented a Traffic Controller, that is set to change the color of the light depending on the time of day. The light will aslso change if there is a request to cross the street and will stop incoming traffic to allow pedestrian to cross.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>To learn more about some of the projects I have accomplished visit my github page <a href="https://github.com/mluna030">here!</a></p>
      <p>Research interest in:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Quantum Architecture, I am hoping to start my journey in designing and learning about quantum computers, to further the advancements in this field.</li>
        <li> Cryptography, Encryption, I would like to help in designing more secure ways to store and transfer data safely and effectively.</li>
        <li>Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence, There are many new applications that we are finding for AI and Intelligent systems that I would like to help implement in any design that I may work on.</li>
      </ol>
